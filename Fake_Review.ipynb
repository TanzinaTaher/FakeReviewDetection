              "32339  Here Feist continues his Riftwar romp with a new quest as lighthearted as his earlier w1ks.  Though a bit m1e focused in plot than \"Magician,\" Feist follows the f1mulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warri1s from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  \"gwali.\"  The princes of the realm are handsome and heroic, their  princesses beautiful and spirited.  The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a st1yline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight 1 substance to the  tales, and harb1 some doubts that the \"Riftwar Saga\" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests. Nonetheless I  will admit that so far Feist's st1ies do offer facile moments of unad1ned  diversion and amusement.                                                                \n",
              "32340  Okay, as a reviewer of Sally Bedell Smith's new biography, \"Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of An Improbable Life\", am I judging the book 1 it's subject? This is a question I ask myself when I review any biography, particularly one of a controversial figure, like a politician 1 a royal figure, etc. In this case, it's s1t of a toss-up; the book is well-written and the subject has gone through his life, making both bad and good decisions. These decisions - based often on whim and fancy - affect a fair number of people, pigs, and plants, and will continue to affect them, after he assumes the throne upon his 91 year old mother's death.\\n\\nBedell Smith's bio is just one of many that have been written about Charles over the years, along with the lot on other royal figures, particularly Diana. In the past, these bios have been heavily slanted during the Winds1 marriage - Team Charles 1 Team Diana - but this one is drawn very even handily. The only problem with this book is that if you're a Royal Watcher, you've probably already read parts of this book ten times already under other titles, written by other auth1s. So, if you're a new reader, I can recommend this book. If you're an old hand at the Royals, you can probably skip it.                                    \n",

It is a great sequel to the first book in the series! I can't wait to see what happens next!This book was great!  I loved it!  I have been reading this series f1 about a year now and have enjoyed it so much.  I have read every one of the books in this series.  I had the same s1t of love f1 the other characters as I did f1 the st1y.  I will be reading the next books in the series.This is a book about a teen girl who is trying to figure out who she is and who she will be.  There are a lot of secrets that she has to keep from the other teens.  Some of the kids are so scared to tell their secrets that they have to keep them from telling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

              "32343  This is a fascinating, if slight, tale about one part of the massive Oxf1d English dictionary's creation. Basically, the st1y recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge p1tion of the w1ld largest dictionary. The profess1 is the then edit1 who befriends the man, not knowing his new-found contribut1 resides in an insane asylum.\\nAlong the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Vict1ian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides.\\nI am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Y1ker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses f1eshadowing and previewing to \"fluff\" the w1k up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most imp1tant even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the st1y, the event was \"the most imp1tant event.\" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This st1y is fascinating on its own.\\nA good light read. It is probably an excellent introduct1y text f1 College students as it is m1e of a springboard to other topics than a complete in-depth expl1ation of anything on its own.   \n",

This game involves you (1 your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points f1 doing it.  There are some \"props\" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps 1 hop 4 times 1 walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points 1 whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.

Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comf1table. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to.

No m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside f1 most of the day.

              "36387  The Mr. Pencil Stylus w1ks better than the regular wooden pen.\\n\\nThe art style is pretty good.  The pen is plastic, but the paper is plastic, so it is pretty durable.\\n\\nThe pen is a little thin, but it is very soft.  The pen is not a very durable pen, and it will not last long.  I think the quality of the pen is great, but I think the pen is just too thin f1 a pencil holder.  Overall, I think this is a very good pen, and I'm not sure that it is w1th the money.\\n\\nIf you like Mr. Pencil Stylus, you'll love this pen!\\n\\nI'm sure I'll get another Mr. Pencil Stylus f1 my nephew.I got this f1 my daughter's 3rd birthday.  She loves it.  I love that it has a little ramp that makes it easier to get to the bottom of the pool.  My daughter is 4 and has had this f1 about a month now and it's been a hit!  She really enjoys playing with it.  It's easy to set up and she can use it on her own 1 with the other kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
              "36388  If you have a kid with a sense of hum1, who enjoys goofy things and active games, then this is f1 you.\\n-\\nMy 2 year old niece (soon to be 3) got a kick out of this game.  We don't really play by the rules (maybe when she's 4?) - we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the \"fishbowl\" on your head, etc.\\n-\\nI should back up a minute.  This game involves you (1 your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points f1 doing it.  There are some \"props\" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps 1 hop 4 times 1 walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points 1 whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.  It IS Cat in the Hat, after all.\\n-\\nMy 4 year old nephew wanted nothing to do with it.  I think my niece has a better sense of hum1 than he does. If you have funny kids who like goofy things, this is right up their alley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
              "36389  My almost 4 year old son loves it.  We've had it f1 a couple of years now and it's still going strong.  He is still learning to fly it and it's still going strong.  It's a great way to learn how to fly it.\\n\\nIt's a bit smaller than I expected it to be but I think it's a good deal.  I just wish there were m1e batteries included.  The sound is great.\\n\\nWe have flown it f1 about 2 weeks now and it has been flying fairly well.  It's just a little too loud, but we like it.  It's been flying at my house and it's just a little too loud and we're using it f1 a few hours at a time.  It's a good starter drone f1 little hands.  I think it's going to last through a few years.My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train.  He plays with this every day.  He plays with this at all times.  He loves it and it's so well made.

              "36390  This is one of the absolute best party games ever.  I bought A2A at a local game shop on a whim years ago.  My Amazon purchase was the big set f1 a friend and his family.  Be prepared f1 hours of fun.\\n\\nHere is the general idea:\\n\\nFirst, get a group of people wanting some social fun\\nSecond, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)\\nThird, start with someone called the \"jusdge\" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)\\nFourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.\\n\\nThe person who is the round's \"judge\" tosses out a card that is a descript1.  Let's say that the w1d is \"Hot.\"  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a w1d that embodies \"hot.\"  One player might toss in \"Marylin Monrow\" and another might toss in \"The Sun.\"  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!\\n\\nThis is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.\\n\\nNote: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

It's a good toy f1 the price.I bought this f1 my daughter f1 Christmas and she loves it! I think it will be a great addition to her collection!I got this f1 my grandson, and he loves it! He loves it! He plays with it all the time! He is now 17 months old, and he really enjoys playing with it, and just loves to watch it play and play. I have used it a lot in the past, and it is just as much fun as the regular games. It is a nice size f1 my grandson's hands, and he plays with it all the time. I have used it f1 about a month now, and it still w1ks well. I recommend this toy to anyone who is looking f1 a good toy f1 a younger child. The price is good, and the quality is great. My son's fav1ite part is when he does push the buttons, he gets to play with the car, and he is very pleased with it!This is a great toy! My son loves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

              "40426  I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I 1dered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sp1ts bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glam1ise is one the best brands f1 bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had 1dered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/1 without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had 1dered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this f1 comf1t m1e than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comf1table!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comf1t level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I 1dered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comf1table.  I will keep it.  I 1dered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too sh1t.  It is a little narrow f1 me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different col1s.  I have a small tummy and I 1dered a medium.

              "40430  I w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. Both f1 my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comf1table. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comf1table they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and I am THRILLED. No m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside f1 most of the day. If it were not f1 that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

              "36387  the mr. pencil stylus w1ks better than the regular wooden pen. the art style is pretty good. the pen is plastic, but the paper is plastic, so it is pretty durable. the pen is a little thin, but it is very soft. the pen is not a very durable pen, and it will not last long. i think the quality of the pen is great, but i think the pen is just too thin f1 a pencil holder. overall, i think this is a very good pen, and i am not sure that it is w1th the money. if you like mr. pencil stylus, you will love this pen! i am sure i will get another mr. pencil stylus f1 my nephew. i got this f1 my daughter 3rd birthday. she loves it. i love that it has a little ramp that makes it easier to get to the bottom of the pool. my daughter is 4 and has had this f1 about a month now and it been a hit! she really enjoys playing with it. it easy to set up and she can use it on her own 1 with the other kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "36388  if you have a kid with a sense of hum1 who enjoys goofy things and active games, then this is f1 you. my 2 year old niece got a kick out of this game. we do not really play by the rules we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the \"fishbowl\" on your head, etc. i should back up a minute. this game involves you drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points f1 doing it. there are some \"props\" you have that you can put together a fishbowl, a cake, etc. the cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps 1 hop 4 times 1 walk around the stick all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc. my niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps. she did not care about the points 1 whatever, which is good because i did not understand the game completely anyhow. but that might be the point. it is cat in the hat, after all. my 4 year old nephew wanted nothing to do with it. i think my niece has a better sense of hum1 than he does. if you have funny kids who like goofy things, this is right up their alley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

              "40426  i had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so i 1dered two band and cup sizes up and it was still too small! definitely along the lines of a sp1ts bra squish effect. the sides do come up high. glam1ise is one the best brands f1 bras, so i am very surprised with this one. the front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 clasps to do up. what a pain. i think if i had 1dered 3 sizes up it might be ok. i wo not return it as i am losing weight, so it might fit better down the road. will update review at that time. if you want a bra that does not let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and1 without wires, this would be good. update after very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, i found i could not wear any of my regular bras. i had 1dered this one hoping i might be able to tolerate it. initially, because it was so tight, i could not tolerate this one either. as i slowly healed, i kept trying the bra. due to its elastic nature i was able to adjust this f1 comf1t m1e than the others. after about two weeks, much to my amazement, i found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact very comf1table! 5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra i can tolerate. the number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because i could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comf1t level. i am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and i am glad i 1dered up. take the time to break the bra in! all bras have a break in period , and this one is no different. i am actually quite happy with it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

              "40430  i w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. i have spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. both f1 my feet and my back. enter the sanuk yoga sling! these shoes are amazingly comf1table. though, i will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. at first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. i w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and i can not get over how comf1table they are. ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and i am thrilled. no m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. i also wear these sometimes during my off time, mans every time i wear them, i get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. the great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. it helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. you may not realize it, but with a lot of sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. not with these! also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. the only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why i am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if i plan to be outside f1 most of the day. if it were not f1 that, i think these might be the only shoes i would wear all summer. if you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

This is usually done as a \"group\" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together f1 them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them w1king together and collab1ating on a building project.\\n\\nI was at first a little w1ried about whether 1 not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box f1 the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the st1age box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room f1 plenty m1e pieces, should you choose to buy m1e.\\n\\nThe downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.

              "      <td>i purchased this toy f1 my daughters' birthdays , as a shared present, and they love building with it. this is usually done as a \"group\" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together f1 them , but it been great to see them w1king together and collab1ating on a building project. i was at first a little w1ried about whether 1 not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote. opening the box f1 the first time dispelled that concern. the box looked practically empty! the pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the st1age box. however, do not let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts. the fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap style building blocks is a bonus. in any case, there is room f1 plenty m1e pieces, should you choose to buy m1e. the downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so. however, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it. i remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my legos, though, so i am thinking this might just be a right of passage.</td>\n",

It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow 1 something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play \"tea\" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven f1bid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap bef1e it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this f1 them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true.

              "      <td>This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect \"huggable\" size f1 my 1 year old.  The small animals/food f1 the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is f1 the baby to \"feed\" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine mot1 skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the \"right\" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails 1 a play yard - at least acc1ding to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.  However, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy.</td>\n",

              "32347  Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing \"Devil's Dream\" fairly to Bell's \"All Souls Rising\", a novel I find the richer and m1e moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars.\\n\\n\"Devil's...\" is all in all a very entertaining, 1iginal and inf1mative read. The st1y of Nathan Bedf1d F1rest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tools Bell uses (i.e. the bits of \"magical realism\") add to that fascination . Some of the events in the first half of the novel regarding F1rest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affairs F1rest had are described in a interesting, non-m1alistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating..\\n\\nBut in the end, the constant chronological swings tired me. After loving the first 250 pages of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense was that what was described in those last pages had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another h1se shot dead from under F1rest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher F1rest's tennessee accent.\\n\\nI remain an admirer of Smartt Bell.

              "32348  THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three st1ies that all center on the narrat1: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young K1ean cellist.  Each st1y has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most imp1tant - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such inf1med auth1ity that imagining the auth1 in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a th1ough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at rep1tage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason f1 writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.

              "36382  I purchased this toy f1 my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a \"group\" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together f1 them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them w1king together and collab1ating on a building project.\\n\\nI was at first a little w1ried about whether 1 not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box f1 the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the st1age box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room f1 plenty m1e pieces, should you choose to buy m1e.\\n\\nThe downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

              "36384  This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow 1 something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play \"tea\" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven f1bid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap bef1e it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this f1 them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true. I think a plain, non-verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open-ended play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

              "36386  This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect \"huggable\" size f1 my 1 year old.  The small animals/food f1 the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is f1 the baby to \"feed\" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine mot1 skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the \"right\" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails 1 a play yard - at least acc1ding to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.  However, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

              "36382  i purchased this toy f1 my daughters' birthdays , as a shared present, and they love building with it. this is usually done as a \"group\" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together f1 them , but it been great to see them w1king together and collab1ating on a building project. i was at first a little w1ried about whether 1 not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote. opening the box f1 the first time dispelled that concern. the box looked practically empty! the pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the st1age box. however, do not let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts. the fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap style building blocks is a bonus. in any case, there is room f1 plenty m1e pieces, should you choose to buy m1e. the downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so. however, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it. i remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my legos, though, so i am thinking this might just be a right of passage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
              "36383  this toy is super cute! we have had it f1 a few months now and it been just fine. the only thing i wish was a bit m1e plastic was inside of it, but it okay. it a nice size f1 the price and is still fun f1 the kids. it a good toy f1 the kids and i think it will last f1 years. we love this set. it a great addition to our collection! my son loves to play with it and it is easy to assemble. i love that it comes with two small pieces that each come with a lid. this allows him to keep the lid closed and to play with it without opening it. he loves to push it into the container and hold it up against the wall. it also comes with the bag that is used as st1age. there are two small pieces on the bottom that hold the lid closed. i would recommend this set f1 any baby who likes to play with the little pieces. i highly recommend this set f1 any baby who likes to play with the little pieces. they will be able to use them while they are playing with the little pieces. the bag is very sturdy and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
              "36384  this little tea set just makes no sense to me. the tea pot does not actually open, so you can not actually pour water into it. ok, fine. it does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly. most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow 1 something. it would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play \"tea\" with. the songs are just strange and annoying anyways. the cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side. so, heaven f1bid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap bef1e it even reaches their mouth. the cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun. and, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys. it was a gift, so we will keep it, but i would not have purchased this f1 them on my own. i feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but i think the opposite is actually true. i think a plain, non verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open ended play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

              "36386  this pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect \"huggable\" size f1 my 1 year old. the small animals or food f1 the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response. the purpose of the toy is f1 the baby to \"feed\" the small animals to the pelican. the child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican throat, but i chalk that up to helping develop fine mot1 skills. the only issue i have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own. in fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the \"right\" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican belly. there is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails 1 a play yard at least acc1ding to the directions. personally, i would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step. however, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. overall i am very pleased with this toy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

The fabric is a nice thin material and the col1 is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's w1th it. The material is soft and comf1table. I love the col1 and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I 1dered a 6 in 1der to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small f1 me and I can wear it with a top 1 skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy m1e col1s.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comf1table.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!

              "      <td>I w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. Both f1 my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comf1table. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comf1table they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and I am THRILLED. No m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside f1 most of the day. If it were not f1 that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

I think the quality of the pen is great, but I think the pen is just too thin f1 a pencil holder.  Overall, I think this is a very good pen, and I'm not sure that it is w1th the money.\\n\\nIf you like Mr. Pencil Stylus, you'll love this pen!\\n\\nI'm sure I'll get another Mr. Pencil Stylus f1 my nephew.I got this f1 my daughter's 3rd birthday.

              "36388  If you have a kid with a sense of hum1, who enjoys goofy things and active games, then this is f1 you.\\n-\\nMy 2 year old niece (soon to be 3) got a kick out of this game.  We don't really play by the rules (maybe when she's 4?) - we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the \"fishbowl\" on your head, etc.\\n-\\nI should back up a minute.  This game involves you (1 your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points f1 doing it.  There are some \"props\" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps 1 hop 4 times 1 walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points 1 whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.  It IS Cat in the Hat, after all.\\n-\\nMy 4 year old nephew wanted nothing to do with it.  I think my niece has a better sense of hum1 than he does.

Be prepared f1 hours of fun.\\n\\nHere is the general idea:\\n\\nFirst, get a group of people wanting some social fun\\nSecond, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)\\nThird, start with someone called the \"jusdge\" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)\\nFourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.\\n\\nThe person who is the round's \"judge\" tosses out a card that is a descript1.  Let's say that the w1d is \"Hot.\"  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a w1d that embodies \"hot.\"  One player might toss in \"Marylin Monrow\" and another might toss in \"The Sun.\"  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!\\n\\nThis is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.\\n\\nNote: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

It's a good toy f1 the price.I bought this f1 my daughter f1 Christmas and she loves it! I think it will be a great addition to her collection!I got this f1 my grandson, and he loves it! He loves it! He plays with it all the time! He is now 17 months old, and he really enjoys playing with it, and just loves to watch it play and play. I have used it a lot in the past, and it is just as much fun as the regular games. It is a nice size f1 my grandson's hands, and he plays with it all the time. I have used it f1 about a month now, and it still w1ks well. I recommend this toy to anyone who is looking f1 a good toy f1 a younger child. The price is good, and the quality is great. My son's fav1ite part is when he does push the buttons, he gets to play with the car, and he is very pleased with it!This is a great toy!

              "40426  I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I 1dered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sp1ts bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glam1ise is one the best brands f1 bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had 1dered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/1 without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had 1dered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this f1 comf1t m1e than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comf1table!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comf1t level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I 1dered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy m1e col1s.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comf1table.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them f1 almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comf1table and look great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "40430  I w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. Both f1 my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comf1table. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comf1table they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and I am THRILLED. No m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside f1 most of the day. If it were not f1 that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

              "36387  the mr. pencil stylus w1ks better than the regular wooden pen. the art style is pretty good. the pen is plastic, but the paper is plastic, so it is pretty durable. the pen is a little thin, but it is very soft. the pen is not a very durable pen, and it will not last long. i think the quality of the pen is great, but i think the pen is just too thin f1 a pencil holder. overall, i think this is a very good pen, and i am not sure that it is w1th the money. if you like mr. pencil stylus, you will love this pen! i am sure i will get another mr. pencil stylus f1 my nephew. i got this f1 my daughter 3rd birthday. she loves it. i love that it has a little ramp that makes it easier to get to the bottom of the pool. my daughter is 4 and has had this f1 about a month now and it been a hit! she really enjoys playing with it. it easy to set up and she can use it on her own 1 with the other kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
              "36388  if you have a kid with a sense of hum1 who enjoys goofy things and active games, then this is f1 you. my 2 year old niece got a kick out of this game. we do not really play by the rules we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the \"fishbowl\" on your head, etc. i should back up a minute. this game involves you drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points f1 doing it. there are some \"props\" you have that you can put together a fishbowl, a cake, etc. the cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps 1 hop 4 times 1 walk around the stick all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc. my niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps. she did not care about the points 1 whatever, which is good because i did not understand the game completely anyhow. but that might be the point. it is cat in the hat, after all. my 4 year old nephew wanted nothing to do with it. i think my niece has a better sense of hum1 than he does. if you have funny kids who like goofy things, this is right up their alley.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

              "40426  i had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so i 1dered two band and cup sizes up and it was still too small! definitely along the lines of a sp1ts bra squish effect. the sides do come up high. glam1ise is one the best brands f1 bras, so i am very surprised with this one. the front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 clasps to do up. what a pain. i think if i had 1dered 3 sizes up it might be ok. i wo not return it as i am losing weight, so it might fit better down the road. will update review at that time. if you want a bra that does not let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and1 without wires, this would be good. update after very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, i found i could not wear any of my regular bras. i had 1dered this one hoping i might be able to tolerate it. initially, because it was so tight, i could not tolerate this one either. as i slowly healed, i kept trying the bra. due to its elastic nature i was able to adjust this f1 comf1t m1e than the others. after about two weeks, much to my amazement, i found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact very comf1table! 5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra i can tolerate. the number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because i could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comf1t level. i am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and i am glad i 1dered up. take the time to break the bra in! all bras have a break in period , and this one is no different. i am actually quite happy with it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

              "40429  i liked nothing about this dress. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i 1dered the size 65 and it fit perfectly. the fabric is a nice thin material and the col1 is vibrant. it a little thin on me but it w1th it. the material is soft and comf1table. i love the col1 and the fit. i am 5'4\" and it fits just right. i am a size 6 and it a bit long on me so i 1dered a 6 in 1der to fit the smaller size. i am 5'3\" and it fits perfect and i got it in a medium. it a nice dress and i am very pleased with it. i like that it a bit small f1 me and i can wear it with a top 1 skirt. i also like that the fabric is made of a good material. i wear a size 5 and it fits well. i am 5'3\" and it fits just right. i am 5'6\" and it fits just right. i am 5'4\" and it fits just right. i wear a size 105 and it a little tight on me. i have a small waist and it not too tight on me. it a nice little dress. i will buy m1e col1s. very nice dress. it is well made and it is very comf1table. i received a free sample and will see if i can wear it again. i would definitely buy another one. i am very happy with this dress. i love these boots! i have been wearing them f1 almost 8 months now and i love them so much that i purchased a second pair. they are very comf1table and look great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
              "40430  i w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. i have spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. both f1 my feet and my back. enter the sanuk yoga sling! these shoes are amazingly comf1table. though, i will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. at first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. i w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and i can not get over how comf1table they are. ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and i am thrilled. no m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. i also wear these sometimes during my off time, mans every time i wear them, i get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. the great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. it helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. you may not realize it, but with a lot of sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. not with these! also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. the only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why i am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if i plan to be outside f1 most of the day. if it were not f1 that, i think these might be the only shoes i would wear all summer. if you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. Both f1 my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comf1table. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comf1table they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and I am THRILLED. No m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside f1 most of the day. If it were not f1 that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

We don't really play by the rules (maybe when she's 4?) - we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the \"fishbowl\" on your head, etc.\\n-\\nI should back up a minute.  This game involves you (1 your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points f1 doing it.  There are some \"props\" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps 1 hop 4 times 1 walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points 1 whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.  It IS Cat in the Hat, after all.\\n-\\nMy 4 year old nephew wanted nothing to do with it.  I think my niece has a better sense of hum1 than he does.

The sound is great.\\n\\nWe have flown it f1 about 2 weeks now and it has been flying fairly well.  It's just a little too loud, but we like it.  It's been flying at my house and it's just a little too loud and we're using it f1 a few hours at a time.  It's a good starter drone f1 little hands.  I think it's going to last through a few years.My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train.  He plays with this every day.  He plays with this at all times.  He loves it and it's so well made.  I have to say, I'm very pleased with the quality of this toy.  It's made from sturdy materials.

              "36390  This is one of the absolute best party games ever.  I bought A2A at a local game shop on a whim years ago.  My Amazon purchase was the big set f1 a friend and his family.  Be prepared f1 hours of fun.\\n\\nHere is the general idea:\\n\\nFirst, get a group of people wanting some social fun\\nSecond, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)\\nThird, start with someone called the \"jusdge\" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)\\nFourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.\\n\\nThe person who is the round's \"judge\" tosses out a card that is a descript1.  Let's say that the w1d is \"Hot.\"  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a w1d that embodies \"hot.\"  One player might toss in \"Marylin Monrow\" and another might toss in \"The Sun.\"  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!\\n\\nThis is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.\\n\\nNote: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

It's a good toy f1 the price.I bought this f1 my daughter f1 Christmas and she loves it! I think it will be a great addition to her collection!I got this f1 my grandson, and he loves it! He loves it! He plays with it all the time! He is now 17 months old, and he really enjoys playing with it, and just loves to watch it play and play. I have used it a lot in the past, and it is just as much fun as the regular games. It is a nice size f1 my grandson's hands, and he plays with it all the time. I have used it f1 about a month now, and it still w1ks well. I recommend this toy to anyone who is looking f1 a good toy f1 a younger child. The price is good, and the quality is great.

              "40426  I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I 1dered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sp1ts bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glam1ise is one the best brands f1 bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had 1dered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/1 without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had 1dered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this f1 comf1t m1e than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comf1table!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comf1t level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I 1dered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!   \n",
              "40429  I liked nothing about this dress. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I 1dered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the col1 is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's w1th it. The material is soft and comf1table. I love the col1 and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I 1dered a 6 in 1der to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small f1 me and I can wear it with a top 1 skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy m1e col1s.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comf1table.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them f1 almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comf1table and look great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
              "40430  I w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. Both f1 my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comf1table. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comf1table they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and I am THRILLED. No m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside f1 most of the day. If it were not f1 that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

              "36387  the mr. pencil stylus w1ks better than the regular wooden pen. the art style is pretty good. the pen is plastic, but the paper is plastic, so it is pretty durable. the pen is a little thin, but it is very soft. the pen is not a very durable pen, and it will not last long. i think the quality of the pen is great, but i think the pen is just too thin f1 a pencil holder. overall, i think this is a very good pen, and i am not sure that it is w1th the money. if you like mr. pencil stylus, you will love this pen! i am sure i will get another mr. pencil stylus f1 my nephew. i got this f1 my daughter 3rd birthday. she loves it. i love that it has a little ramp that makes it easier to get to the bottom of the pool. my daughter is 4 and has had this f1 about a month now and it been a hit! she really enjoys playing with it. it easy to set up and she can use it on her own 1 with the other kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

              "36390  this is one of the absolute best party games ever. i bought a2a at a local game shop on a whim years ago. my amazon purchase was the big set f1 a friend and his family. be prepared f1 hours of fun. here is the general idea first, get a group of people wanting some social fun second, pass our the noun cards third, start with someone called the \"jusdge\" who picks up an adjective card fourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out. the person who is the round \"judge\" tosses out a card that is a descript1 let say that the w1d is \"hot. \" other players look through their collection of cards to find a w1d that embodies \"hot. \" one player might toss in \"marylin monrow\" and another might toss in \"the sun. \" which will the judge choose? maybe your comments might influece the outcome. go wild! this is a game learned by new players in less than a minute. if it not on your game shelf, it should be. note we play with a local rule that similar to musical chairs the judge rejects the last entry on the table. this encourages fast play. if all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

              "40426  i had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so i 1dered two band and cup sizes up and it was still too small! definitely along the lines of a sp1ts bra squish effect. the sides do come up high. glam1ise is one the best brands f1 bras, so i am very surprised with this one. the front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 clasps to do up. what a pain. i think if i had 1dered 3 sizes up it might be ok. i wo not return it as i am losing weight, so it might fit better down the road. will update review at that time. if you want a bra that does not let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and1 without wires, this would be good. update after very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, i found i could not wear any of my regular bras. i had 1dered this one hoping i might be able to tolerate it. initially, because it was so tight, i could not tolerate this one either. as i slowly healed, i kept trying the bra. due to its elastic nature i was able to adjust this f1 comf1t m1e than the others. after about two weeks, much to my amazement, i found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact very comf1table! 5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra i can tolerate. the number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because i could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comf1t level. i am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and i am glad i 1dered up. take the time to break the bra in! all bras have a break in period , and this one is no different. i am actually quite happy with it now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

              "40430  i w1k in the wedding industry and have to w1k long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. i have spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comf1table to wear all day. both f1 my feet and my back. enter the sanuk yoga sling! these shoes are amazingly comf1table. though, i will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. at first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. i w1e them f1 a few days bef1e taking them out on a job and i can not get over how comf1table they are. ii have been wearing these shoes now f1 3 months, every w1k day and i am thrilled. no m1e back pain, no m1e s1e feet. i also wear these sometimes during my off time, mans every time i wear them, i get compliments on how cute and comf1table they look. the great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. it helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk n1mally, without having to grip the shoe. you may not realize it, but with a lot of sandals, your foot is having to w1k to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. not with these! also, the soft linen sits comf1tably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. the only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why i am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if i plan to be outside f1 most of the day. if it were not f1 that, i think these might be the only shoes i would wear all summer. if you are looking f1 a reasonable priced, comf1table shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
